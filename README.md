In this section we will talk about text editor ,command line and show an exemple of some navigation 

# 1.What Is a Text Editor 
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. 

# 2.Comparison of text editor vs IDE:
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title.it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. It wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

## 3.The Command Line:
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by
typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
these are how we oppen it on our comupters:
- Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. 
- On Linux  you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities


## 4.Basic Navigation:

> pwd : It tells you what your current or present working directory
> ls: It's short for list and it return what is in present directory 
> cd: to move around in the system
